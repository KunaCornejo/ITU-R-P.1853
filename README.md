# The Dynamic Rain Attenuation Model
Despite that several time-series models to synthesize rain attenuation samples with temporal properties have been studied and proposed, only one model has been stood out. This model was based on the Maseng-Bakken model, which was implemented as a new recommendation by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), ITU-R P.1853.

The ITU Recommendation P.1853 details how the time series synthesis method generates a time series that reproduces the spectral characteristics, fade slope and fade duration statistics of rain attenuation events. Also, the statistics of the inter-fade duration are reproduced but solely within individual events of the rain-attenuation.
